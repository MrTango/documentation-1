Page Management
=================

Many times scanning documents in bulk results in documents with blank pages;
some pages my be out of order or maybe part of totally different document.
Even if you notice these flaws immediately it is time consuming and
frustrating to redo scanning process.
Wouldn't it be nice to fix out of order pages with Papermerge?

Page management is set of features which helps to fix scanning process errors.
In other words you can delete, reorder, cut and paste pages within same
document even outside it.

.. note::

    In order perform any of operations described below (delete, reorder, cut and
    paste pages) you need to have **Change Permission** on respective document.
    You have automatically granted **Change Permission**
    on the documents you uploaded (because you own the documents uploaded by you).

Delete Page(s)
**************

You can delete specific pages (for instance blank pages) from the document.
Although many scanners have automatic "remove blank pages" feature, many times
they (scanners) get confused of what is a blank page or what is not. In case
your scans end up with undesired blank pages you can easily remove those
pages. Obviously you can remove any page which you consider that should not be
part of current document.

Reorder Pages
***************

Out of order pages occur very often during scanning process. Papermerge allows users
to change pages order within the document.


Cut & Paste
*************

You can move document pages around from one document to another. Once you cut
one or several pages from a document, you can paste them either inside another
document - pages will become part of new document or you can paste pages in
file browser, this will create entirely new document from cut pages.
