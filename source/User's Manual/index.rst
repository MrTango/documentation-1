User's Manual
===============

Papermerge is designed to be very intuitive. Because its user interface
resembles a typical desktop file browser, you will be able to use Papermerge
for basic document management tasks without any training at all. However it is
a very good idea to get familiar with few high-level concepts before staring
to use Papermerge.

This user manual starts by introducing you to important concepts, you should
be familiar with.
