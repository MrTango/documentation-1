Metadata
==========

Main Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Metadata is extra information about your folders, documents and pages. In
other words - data about your data. Following picture is a (scanned document)
receipt with highlighted shop name, price and date on it.

   Receipt with metadata

This additional information - shop name, price and date is so called document's **metadata**. It has two parts a label (in picture above ``shop``, ``date`` and ``price`` are all labels) and a value (in example above values are ``MÃ¤c-Geiz``, ``08.06.2020``, ``1.49`` for shop label, date label and price label respectively). Many times instead of term *label* term *key* is used.
Metadata is extremely useful when you need to locate specific document among many other very similar documents.

Imagine that you scanned 60 groceries receipts and *organized* them in a
folder named Groceries. If you would just store those receipts on an ordinary
file system, then only way to distinguish between files is by file names or
maybe by their text content (if your storage supports OCR) - finding, specific
file, say all receipts you got in June 2020, would be time consuming.

A more efficient and practical way to tackle this problem is by associating to
all scanned documents (receipts in this example) - metadata. Let's continue
with groceries receipts example. It would be very time consuming to go to each
document and add metadata to each file individually. A faster way to create
metadata and associated it to a group of files, is by a creating a folder -
add metadata to that folder - let's name it Groceries-2020 - and then just
copy all groceries related files into that folder.

   Metadata is inherited from folder to all documents within it



Add, Edit, Delete Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Metadata is added/editing via metadata widget located on the right bar.
Depending on the context - adding or edditing metadata differs slightly: 
while you are browsing files and documents you will be able to edit only
metadata keys. However, in document viewer, you will be able to add or edit
both keys and values for metadata.
