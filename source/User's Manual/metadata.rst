Main Concepts

Metadata is added/editing via metadata widget located on the right bar.
Depending on the context - adding or edditing metadata differs slightly: 
while you are browsing files and documents you will be able to edit only
metadata keys. However, in document viewer, you will be able to add or edit
both keys and values for metadata.
