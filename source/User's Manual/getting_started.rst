Documents
~~~~~~~~~~

Let's start by clarifying the most important concept first: the document. For
Papermerge a document is anything which is a good candidate for archiving -
some piece of information which is not editable but you need to store it for
future reference. For example receipts - you donâ€™t need to edit receipts or
read them everyday, but eventually you will need them for your tax
declaration. In this sense - scanned documents, which are usually in PDF or
TIFF format, are perfect match.

Another important thing - if you take a picture of a paper document with your
mobile phone - you'll have a file in jpeg format (or maybe png file format).
In context of Papermerge that picture of a document (though just a single jpeg
file) is a valid one page document. Generally speaking, pictures of the
documents produced by your camera - might be regarded as bad quality scans.

On the other hand, if you take a picture of a flower and upload that jpeg
image to Papermerge - the 'document' will be processed. However, that jpeg
format flower image is not a document in Papermerge sense.

Usually office formats with .docx (Microsoft Word), .odt (Libre Office), .txt
(plain text) are not good candidates for archiving - as by their nature they
are meant to be changed/edit regularly. However, once converted to PDF format
(for instance Contract_C2.docx to Contract_C2.pdf) they are full fledged
documents in Papermege sense.

By default, Papermerge works with documents in 4 (four) file formats: pdf,
tiff, jpeg and png. However, many other formats (even email messages) can be
imported as documents by converting incoming file *automatically* to PDF
format. This is possible due to :ref:`document_pipelines` feature.
