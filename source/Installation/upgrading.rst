Upgrading
==========

Always backup your database, media directory and configuration files before
upgrading. We try very hard to make sure that all database changes are
non-destructive, but you should always backup beforehand anyway. You will
never regret backing up your database. You may regret not doing so, so itâ€™s
just better to get into the habit.
