Welcome to Papermerge Documentation!
=======================================

I have nothing against paper. Paper is a brilliant invention of humanity. But in the 21st century I find it more appropriate for paper-based documents to be digitized (scanned). Once scanned, appropriate software can be used to find any document in a fraction of a second, just by typing a few keywords.

Papermerge is a document management system designed to work with scanned documents. As well as OCR with full text search, it provides the look and feel of major modern file browsers, with tags and hierarchical structure for files and folders, so that you can organize your documents in a similar way to Dropbox (via web) or Google Drive (but with tags and other cool features).
